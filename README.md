# Company-employs-data-analysis-using-MS-excel
Completed a data analysis project on a company dataset using Microsoft Excel.

I performed data cleaning, removed duplicates, handled missing values, and created insights using pivot tables and charts.
Analyzed salary distribution, department counts, gender ratios, performance ratings, and bonus calculations.
Also explored how salary changes with age and built an interactive dashboard using Excel tools.
This project helped me improve my Excel skills in real-world data analysis, reporting, and visualization.

• Cleaned and structured raw company data for accurate analysis
• Identified duplicate records and removed them to improve data quality
• Calculated total salary, department count, rating scores, and bonus amounts
